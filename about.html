                        <h2>Hernan Isidoro</h2>
                        <p>From Los Angeles to New York City, I’m a second generation immigrant   I’ve worked at WES— World Education Service, A company that connects immigrants from all over the world with an education or/and Immigration needs. Explored 3 Countries, including my home country Mexico. Won a bartenders cup for whiskey spirit as Mixology is my craft. </p>
                        <p>Oh, and I also take photos in my spare time.</p>
                        <p>At least this is how I’d like my bio to read. :-)</p>
                        <p>Truth is that I have a very cool “Side-Hustle” that I see as my Hobby. I’m a self made “Street Photographer”. Over the last 4 years, I have shot lifestyle images for stock photography agencies such as  Univision. I’ve been lucky to work with some amazing people, both at these agencies and on my teams of models, producers, stylists, and assistants. I’ve had my photos published for  commercial purposes and assisted on television production and have had some great commercial clients along the way as well. In the last  months, I switched to shooting travel images and fell in love with photography all over again.</p>
                        <p>My travel & photography blog has become part of my journey to see the world in a new way and I’m pleased to share that vision with you. I love what I do, as well as the people and places I photograph. Each person and every place has its own story. But sometimes the best stories are the ones you star in.</p>
                        <p>The most well rounded human is one that travels and submerges them self fully into the culture and takes away all the positives and applies that to his lifestyle.</p>
                        <p>So here I am on the road to discover the world around me and to take a whole lotta photos while I’m at it. There is a big world out there and it is calling. </p>
